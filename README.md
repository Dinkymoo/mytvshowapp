1. The perfomance is good - no virtual DOM and has a high frame rate
2. The size of the application is small, +-20KB depending
3. It can be run in different browsers, making it very flexible
4. Updates are made easy in Vue, making it future proof
5. The library is well documented and the ecosystem is well defined
   this decreases the development time
6. Vue can be integrated with existing web applications, as it is based on JavaScript
7. Vue applications can be introduced component by component, making it progressive in nature
8. It is known to be easier to learn, which I will try to prove while making this application
