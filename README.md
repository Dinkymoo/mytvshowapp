The reason I chose Vue:

1. The perfomance is good - no virtual DOM and has a high frame rate
2. The size of the application is small, +-20KB depending
3. It can be run in different browsers, making it very flexible
4. Updates are made easy in Vue, making it future proof
5. The library is well documented and the ecosystem is well defined
   this decreases the development time
6. Vue can be integrated with existing web applications, as it is based on JavaScript
7. Vue applications can be introduced component by component, making it progressive in nature
8. It is known to be easier to learn, which I will try to prove while making this application
   as it is my first application in Vue

How to run this application:

1. Make sure that you have node intstalled
2. Run npm install
3. Open the project in root folder mytvshowapp
4. Run npm start
5. Open a browser on http://localhost:3000

How to run the tests:

1. Open the project in root folder mytvshowapp
2. Run npx jest

Future features:
1. A login page (partially completed login included)
2. Lazy loading, especially if the application expands into more pages and features
3. Improved styling and layout
4. More unit tests
5. Selecting more than one category at a time
